# How to contribute
This projects welcomes contributions and corrections. Before contributing, please make sure you have read the guidelines below. 
If you decide to contribute anything, please do the following:


## General Instructions
Pull requests are the easiest and preferred method to contribute to any repo at Github.

1. Fork this repository, or update if you've already forked it before. 
2. Create a new branch specific to the issue you are working on with ``git checkout -b feature_name``. This action will separate the new feature from any other changes you may do and will make it easier to edit or ammend (read more [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)). 
3. Add your files on the new branch
4. Commit locally and push to the new branch with ``git push -u origin feature_name``
5. Go to GIthub and make a pull request, please include all the information possible. 

## Working on Existent Issues

Please check the issues tab to find something to contribute with. Before starting to work on the selected issue make sure to check the comment thread to check that no one else has already started to work on it.
If no one is working on it then make a comment that you have the intention to do so. This way duplicated work can be avoided. 

If someone has already commented about their intentions to fix the issue but nothing has been submitted after 2 or 3 weeks, then it's acceptable to still pick up the issue but make sure to leave a comment.

## Working on New Issues

If you have detected a new issue that needs to be fixed or you would like to add more functionalities please make sure to create an issue. 
Before you submit a new issue please make sure that:
- Is a request that has not been done yet. Check closed issues as well. 
- Isn't related to anything that provides an illegal service (e.g. piracy, malware, threatening material, spam, etc.).

If you are in doubt, feel free to submit it and we'll have a look.
